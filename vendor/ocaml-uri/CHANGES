* Be lenient about decoding incorrect encoded percent-strings (#31).
* Improve ocamldoc for `Uri.of_string`.
* Regenerate build files with OASIS 0.4.1.
* Add an `mldylib` to build the cmxs Natdynlink plugin properly (#29).

1.3.11 (2013-10-13):
* Add relative-relative URI resolution support.
* OCamldoc fixes.
* Add Travis continous build tests.

1.3.10 (2013-09-05):
* Rename `Install_printer` to `Uri_top` to prevent conflict with other libraries with similar name (#24).

1.3.9 (2013-08-30):
* Add back support for OCaml 3.12.1 by fixing the compiler-libs linking.

1.3.8 (2013-05-19):
* Add `Uri.get_query_param` which selects a single value for a query key.
* Add `Uri.get_query_param'` which returns a list of values associated with a query key.
* Fix ocamldoc in `Uri` module to have a header.

1.3.7 (2013-01-23):
* Add a top-level printer for `Uri.t` that converts it to a string instead
  of just displaying an `<abstract>` type.

* Add `with_host`, `with_port`, `with_fragment` and `with_host`, to modify

* Add `Uri.remove_query_param` function to remove keys from query sets.

1.3.4 (2012-11-08):
* Always encode `+` in URLs to be more compatible with form encoding.

1.3.3 (2012-10-14):
* Add singleton variants of query functions that accept a string->string
  instead of a string list of values, for convenience.

1.3.2 (2012-09-20):
* Fix parsing of unreserved characters in hostnames (e.g. `foo-bar.com`).
* Add unit tests for the Uri_services module.
* Various URI parsing bugs and test cases for better RFC3986 compliance.
* Fix `port_of_uri` to detect port overrides in a URI before doing a lookup.

1.3.1 (2012-09-12):
