## Terrateam
[Terrateam](https://terrateam.io) is an open-source GitOps CI/CD platform for automating infrastructure workflows. It integrates with GitHub to orchestrate Terraform, OpenTofu, CDKTF, Terragrunt, and Pulumi operations via pull requests. Use our hosted service or run on-premise.

### Why Terrateam
#### **True GitOps**
Every part of your Terrateam configuration lives directly in Git, right alongside your code. Branch, merge, and revert configurations exactly like code, with no external setup or separate configuration files. This ensures full version control, traceability, and seamless integration with your existing Git workflows.

#### Built for Scale and Reliability
- **GitHub-Native**: Manage Terraform workflows in GitHub with Actions, PRs, and Secrets, no extra tools.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: RBAC, SSO, and audit trails for secure, compliant infrastructure.
- **High Availability**: Handles parallel execution, multi-repo environments with distributed architecture.
- **Drift Detection**: Alerts teams when live infrastructure diverges from infrastructure as code.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Easily manage dev, staging, and production environments.

Terrateam combines powerful GitOps automation with enterprise-ready security and scalability, all directly in GitHub.

## Getting Started
### Terrateam SaaS
Get started quickly with our free SaaS version by signing up at [https://terrateam.io](https://terrateam.io).

### Self-Hosted Deployment
For those who prefer more control, you can deploy Terrateam in your own environment.

#### Local Setup with Docker Compose
##### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- A way to expose the Terrateam server to the internet. The server must be able to receive GitHub webhooks and allow the GitHub Action to communicate with it.
  - **For local testing:** Terrateam supports [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) natively through the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. Alternatively, you can use [any tunneling](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling) or reverse proxy tool that fits your needs.
  - **For production environments:** It is recommended to use a load balancer or another production-grade solution for secure and reliable communication. [Read the docs](https://docs.terrateam.io/self-hosted/overview/) for more details.

#### Terrateam Setup Steps

1. **Clone the `terrateamio/terrateam` repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam.git
   cd terrateam/docker/terrat
   ```

2. **Start the Terrateam setup container:**
   ```sh
   GH_ORG=YOUR_GITHUB_ORG docker-compose up setup
   ```

   If you're using a GitHub Enterprise server, set the `GHE_HOST` environment variable:
   ```sh
   GHE_HOST=github.mycompany.com GH_ORG=YOUR_GITHUB_ORG docker-compose up setup
   ```

3. **Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to create your private Terrateam GitHub application. Take note of your application URL for use below.

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Do not install your private Terrateam GitHub application until you complete the steps below.

4. **Save the generated GitHub application settings**
   Create a `.env` file in the `terrateam/docker/terrat` directory, next to the `docker-compose.yml` file, and save the settings there.

5. **Stop the Terrateam setup container** by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the container.

6. **Start the Terrateam Server:**
   [Get your Ngrok auth token here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
   ```sh
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<YOUR-NGROK-AUTH-TOKEN> docker-compose up -d server
   ```

   If you're using a GitHub Enterprise server that can communicate directly with the Terrateam server, use the following environment variables to start the server:
   ```sh
   TERRAT_API_BASE=https://terrateam.example.com GITHUB_API_BASE_URL=https://api.github.example.com GITHUB_WEB_BASE_URL=https://github.example.com docker-compose up server -d
   ```
   
7. **Wait for the server to be ready.** The `docker-compose` command will return you to your shell when the Terrateam Server is ready for connections.

8. **Install your private Terrateam GitHub application** using the application URL from step 3. You can install Terrateam against your entire organization or specific repositories.

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Ensure the Terrateam Server is running (see step 7) before installing the GitHub application.

9. **Add the Terrateam GitHub Actions Workflow**
   Download [terrateam.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrateamio/terrateam-example/main/github/actions/workflows/default/terrateam.yml) and
   save it in your repository under `.github/workflows/terrateam.yml`. The Terrateam GitHub Actions workflow file must reside in the default branch of your Terraform repository, typically named `main` or `master`.

10. **Start Using Terrateam**
    Create a pull request with a Terraform code change to automatically trigger a Terraform `Plan` operation. For detailed instructions on your first Terrateam deployment, refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.terrateam.io/quickstart-guide#your-first-terrateam-deployment).

For non-local setup instructions, including manual setup and Kubernetes deployment options, follow our [Self-Hosted Guide](https://docs.terrateam.io/self-hosted/overview) to get up and running.

- **Terrateam Server**: Orchestrates infrastructure, scalable for complex environments and parallel operations.
- **GitHub Application**: Enables GitOps workflows with native GitHub functionality.
- **GitHub Actions**: Powers infrastructure as code executions.
- **Postgres Database**: Securely stores operations data and configurations for consistency and auditability.

For more details, see our [How It Works Documentation](https://docs.terrateam.io/how-it-works).

## Configuration
Terrateam’s configuration is managed in an in-repo `.terrateam/config.yml` file, providing flexibility for custom workflows and advanced settings. You can also dynamically generate configurations using the `config_builder` for even more control.

For more details and example configurations, explore the [Configuration Reference](https://docs.terrateam.io/configuration-reference/) and [Advanced Workflows](https://docs.terrateam.io/advanced-workflows/) sections of our documentation to customize Terrateam to your specific use cases.
