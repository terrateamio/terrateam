description: API endpoints that list, create, update, and delete users, change passwords, set the installation admin, and create service accounts.
order: 3
---


These endpoints list, create, update, and delete users, change their passwords, set installation admin status, and create service accounts.

## Permissions

- Each endpoint requires an `admin` or `users-manage` grant of any scope. List users requires one that is not scoped to tenants.
- Update, delete, and change password also require strictly more authority than the target user, who must belong only to tenants that your grant reaches. Otherwise the answer is `403 CAPABILITY_UNAUTHORIZED`.
- Get user details requires only that the user belongs to tenants that your grant reaches.

See [Tenants](/docs/admin/access-control/tenants) for who can act on whom.

## Users

### List users

```text
GET /api/v1/users
```

Returns users, with cursor-based pagination and filters.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | query | No | Filter by user type: `user`, `api`, or `system` |
| `limit` | query | No | Max results (default: 25) |
| `cursor` | query | No | Pagination cursor from the previous response |
| `search` | query | No | Search by name or email |

Response:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "f30ed1f9-be44-46a3-9050-03e9561e94f0",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "admin_rights": { "is_instance_admin": false, "is_tenant_admin": false },
      "type": "user",
      "auth_origin": "local",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 10,
  "limit": 25,
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `users` | array | List of user objects |
| `total_count` | integer | Total number of matching users |
| `limit` | integer | Limit used for this request |
| `has_more` | boolean | Whether more results are available |
| `next_cursor` | string | Cursor for the next page (null if no more) |
| `auth_origin` | string | Authentication origin (for example `local`, `google`, `oidc`) |
| `admin_rights.is_instance_admin` | boolean | Whether the user administers the whole installation |
| `admin_rights.is_tenant_admin` | boolean | Whether the user administers named tenants rather than the installation. Never true at the same time as `is_instance_admin` |

### Get user details

```text
GET /api/v1/users/detail?user_id={user_id}
```

Returns the details of one user.

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "f30ed1f9-be44-46a3-9050-03e9561e94f0",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "admin_rights": { "is_instance_admin": false, "is_tenant_admin": false },
  "type": "user",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

The response also includes `auth_origin` (how the user authenticates) and `avatar_url` when they are set.

### Create user

```text
POST /api/v1/users
```

Creates a user account.

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "password": "secure-password",
  "is_instance_admin": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name |
| `email` | string | No | Email address (used for login) |
| `password` | string | Yes | Password (8 to 128 characters) |
| `is_instance_admin` | boolean | No | Grant the installation-wide admin capability (default: false). You cannot create a tenant-scoped admin here. Grant one afterwards with [Set member role](/docs/reference/api/tenants#set-member-role). |

Response: `201 Created`

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "is_instance_admin": false
}
```

The new user joins each of your tenants that your grant reaches. If it reaches none, the answer is `403`. Setting `is_instance_admin` requires an installation-wide `admin` grant.

### Update user

```text
PUT /api/v1/users/update?user_id={user_id}
```

Updates a user.

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | No | Display name |
| `email` | string | No | Email address (admin sessions only) |
| `avatar_url` | string | No | Avatar URL |
| `is_instance_admin` | boolean | No | Grant or revoke the installation-wide admin capability (admin sessions only), the same write and the same refusals as `POST /api/v1/users/set-instance-admin`. Omit it to leave the admin grant of the user unchanged. |

Response: `200 OK` with the updated user object, with the same `admin_rights` object as the users list and the user details.

`is_instance_admin: false` on the last installation admin returns `400 CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN`, and on yourself returns `400 CANNOT_ACT_ON_SELF`. Either refusal discards the whole update: `name`, `email`, and `avatar_url` are written in the same transaction, so none of them is saved.

### Delete user

```text
DELETE /api/v1/users/delete?user_id={user_id}
```

Soft-deletes a user: marks the user as deleted and invalidates their API keys.

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "f30ed1f9-be44-46a3-9050-03e9561e94f0",
  "deleted": true
}
```

Errors:

- `403` when the target holds as much authority as you or more, or belongs to a tenant that your grant does not reach. Instance admins are exempt and can delete each other.
- A `users-manage` holder cannot delete an admin or another `users-manage` holder.
- `400 CANNOT_DELETE_LAST_ADMIN` for the last instance admin.
- `400 CANNOT_DELETE_OWN_ACCOUNT` for your own account.

### Change user password

```text
POST /api/v1/users/change-password?user_id={user_id}
```

Changes the password of a user.

Request body:

```json
{
  "new_password": "new-secure-password",
  "current_password": "old-password"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `new_password` | string | Yes | New password (8 to 128 characters) |
| `current_password` | string | Conditional | Required when you change your own password, whatever capabilities you hold, admins included |

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "f30ed1f9-be44-46a3-9050-03e9561e94f0",
  "password_changed": true
}
```

Another user's password requires no `current_password`. Instance admins are exempt from the authority comparison in [Permissions](#permissions), and can reset each other's passwords.

### Set installation admin status

```text
POST /api/v1/users/set-instance-admin?user_id={user_id}
```

Sets the installation-wide `admin` capability of the user to the requested value:

- `true` writes an unrestricted admin capability, and replaces any tenants allow-list that the user held.
- `false` removes an unrestricted admin capability and leaves a tenant-scoped one untouched. On a user who never held the installation-wide grant, it changes nothing.

Request body:

```json
{
  "is_instance_admin": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `is_instance_admin` | boolean | Yes | The installation-wide admin grant to leave the user with |

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "f30ed1f9-be44-46a3-9050-03e9561e94f0",
  "is_instance_admin": true
}
```

The value is set, not toggled: the server never reads the current grant to invert it, so a repeated call changes nothing. Removing the grant from the last installation admin returns `400 CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN`, and removing your own returns `400 CANNOT_ACT_ON_SELF`, whoever else holds one.

## Service accounts

### Create service account

```text
POST /api/v1/api-users
```

Creates a service account (API user) for programmatic access.

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "ci-production",
  "tenant_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "user_id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

The response shows the token only one time. Save it immediately.
