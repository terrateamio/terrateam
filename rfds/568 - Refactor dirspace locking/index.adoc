== Background

A core functionality of Terrateam is "dirspace locking".  This is distinct from
Terraform/Tofu state locking, which ensures serialized access to a state during
a specific Terraform/Tofu operation.  Dirspace locking ensures that a change to
a set of dirspaces which are in-progress prevent any overlapping changes from
being applied until the in-progress change is completed.

The definition of "in-progress" depends on some configuration, however the
strictness definition is a pull request that has either applied at least one of
its dirspaces or has been merged without applying all of its dirspaces.  Once
both operations are performed (merge and apply of all dirspaces) then all
dirspaces are unlocked.

There is also a configuration called `lock_policy` which can be used to modify
which operations lock a dirspace.

Finally, because merging is important to locking, it is important where the
change is merged into.  Currently, Terrateam does not distinguish between which
branches a pull request is merged into in locking.  For example, if we have a
pull request `PR1` that merges `Branch1` into `main` and a pull request `PR2`
that merges `Branch2` into `staging`, and both pull requests modify the dirspace
`DS1`, Terrateam, by default, consider these to be conflicting changes.
However, it can be configured to lock based on the destination branch.

NOTE:: This is not implemented in the current version of the code, this RFD adds
support for it.

It is probably easiest to understand dirspace locking in the form of a series
examples:

=== Scenarios

==== Scenario 1: Apply First

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. `DS1` in `PR1` is applied (`DS1` is now locked).
. `PR1` is merged (`DS1` is now unlocked).


==== Scenario 2: Merge First

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. `PR1` is merged (`DS1` is now locked).
. `PR1` is applied (`DS1` is now unlocked).


==== Scenario 3: Apply First, Multiple Dirspaces

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2`.
. `DS1` is applied in `PR1` (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are locked).
. `DS2` is applied in `PR1` (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are still locked).
. `PR1` is merged (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are now unlocked).


==== Scenario 4: Merge First, Multiple Dirspaces

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2`.
. `PR1` is merged (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are locked).
. `DS1` is applied (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are still locked).
. `DS2` is applied (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are now unlocked).


==== Scenario 5: Apply, Merge, Apply

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2`.
. `DS1` is applied (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are locked).
. Pull request `PR1` is merged (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are still locked).
. `DS2` is applied (dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are now unlocked).


==== Scenario 6: Locking is Contagious

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2`.
. Pull request `PR2` is created which changes dirspaces `DS2` and `DS3`.
. Either by merging or applying in `PR1`, the dirspaces `DS1` and `DS2` are
locked.
. Pull request `PR2` attempts to apply `DS3`, however it is blocked because
`DS2` is locked by `PR1`, and thus no changes in `PR2` can be applied until
`PR1` is completed.

==== Scenario 6: Unlocking

Terrateam supports an escape hatch via the `unlock` operation which allows
releasing any locks associated with a pull request.

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. `PR1` is either applied OR merged (dirspace `DS1` is now locked).
. The user comments on the pull request `terrateam unlock` (dirspace `DS1` is now
unlocked).

==== Scenario 7: Multiple Locks by Apply and Merge

It is possible for a dirspace to be locked by multiple pull requests.  While
Terrateam can control if an apply happens it cannot control if a merge happens.

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. Pull request `PR2` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. Pull request `PR1` applies `DS1` (dirspace `DS1` is now locked by `PR1`).
. Pull request `PR2` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is locked by `PR1` and `PR2`).
. Pull request `PR1` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is now locked only by `PR2`).
. `DS1` is applied in `PR1` (dirspace `DS1` is now unlocked).

==== Scenario 8: Multiple Locks by Merge

If a dirspace is locked because multiple pull requests have been merged, they
will prevent each other from performing an apply, making it impossible to
continue.  To deal with this, a user must `unlock`.

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. Pull request `PR2` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. `PR1` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is now locked by `PR1`).
. `PR2` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is not locked by `PR1` and `PR2`).
. User tries to perform `terrateam apply` on `PR1`, Terrateam fails saying `DS1`
is locked by `PR2`.
. User tries to perform `terrateam apply` on `PR2`, Terrateam fails saying `DS1`
is locked by `PR1`.
. User performs `terrateam unlock` on `PR2` (dirspace `DS1` is now locked only
by `PR1`).
. User performs `terrateam apply` on `PR1`, which succeeds (dirspace `DS1` is no
now unlocked).

==== Scenario 9: Lock policy `apply`

The previous scenarios have all used the `strict` lock policy, unless otherwise
mentioned.  The `apply` lock policy configures Terrateam that a dirspace is
locked only if an `apply` is performed on it.

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1` which is configured
with `lock_policy: apply`.
. Pull request `PR1` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is not locked).
. Pull request `PR2` is created which changes dirspace `DS1`.
. `DS1` is applied in `PR2` (dirspace `DS1` is now locked by `PR2`).
. `PR2` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is now unlocked).

==== Scenario 10: Lock policy `merge`

The previous scenarios have all used the `strict` lock policy, unless otherwise
mentioned.  The `merge` lock policy configures Terrateam that a dirspace is
locked only if the pull request is merged.

. Pull request `PR1` is created which changes dirspace `DS1` which is configured
with `lock_policy: merge`.
. `DS1` is applied in `PR1` (dirspace `DS1` is not locked).
. Pull request `PR2` is created hich changes dirspace `DS1`.
. Pull request `PR2` is merged (dirspace `DS1` is now locked by `PR1`).
. `DS1` is applied in `PR2` (dirspace `DS1` is now unlocked).

==== Scenario 11: Branch lock policy `dest_branch`

NOTE:: This scenario is not implemented in the current code base.

Most users configure Terrateam to always merge against a single destination
branch, the default branch of the repository, however Terrateam supports
configuring other destination branches.  This can be used for doing
environment-per-branch workflows.

By default, locks on a dirspace are across all destination branches, this is the
`all` configuration.  Given multiple pull requests to different branches, a lock
on `DS1` impacts all of them.  However, the branch policy can be specified to be
per-destination branch, allowing changes to each dirspace to move at its own
pace rather than in lockstep.

. Pull request `PR1` is created targeting the `main` branch which changes
dirspace `DS1` which is configure with `lock_policy.branch: dest_branch`.
. Pull request `PR2` is created targeting the `main` branch which changes
dirspace `DS1` which is configure with `lock_policy.branch: dest_branch`.
. Pull request `PR1` is merged OR `DS1` is applied (dirspace `DS1` is now locked
by `PR1` for target branch `main`).
. Pull request `PR2` applies `DS1`, which works (dirspace `DS2` is now locked by
`PR2` for target branch `dev`).
. Pull request `PR3` is created targeting the `main` branch which changes
dirspace `DS1`.
. Pull request `PR4` is created targeting `dev` branch which changes dirspace
`DS1`.
. User performs `terrateam apply` on `PR3`, which fails stating that `PR1` has locked
dirspace `DS1`.
. User performs `terrateam apply` on `PR4`, which fails stating that `PR2` has
locked dirspace `DS1`.


=== Issues with current implementation

The current implementation is done by a large query.  When evaluating if a
particular dirspace can be applied in a particular pull request, the query finds
all pull requests for that repository that have ever changed that dirspace and
determines if it owns any locks.

This query is problematic for a few reasons:

. It is expensive.  It requires evaluating the entire history of a repository.
. It only becomes more expensive, because as the repository is used more pull
requests are added.
. The query is very large and difficult to change and understand.
. It does not implement the `dest_branch` configuration and it would be
challenging to implement it.
. This query evaluates a lot of data that is unnecessary.  In most cases, a
dirspace will be locked by a single pull request, but the current query requires
searching through all pull requests.
. We want to expand usage of Terrateam to include APIs.  The current query is so
large and unwieldy that it makes it difficult and error prone to include more
usecases.
. It is difficult to query the database for which dirspaces are locked and by
whom, as that is an even more expensive query.

The query has the benefit that locks are an emergent behaviour of the state of
the repository, not explicit state that needs to be tracked over time.  This
means that the locks are always correct.

== Proposal

CAUTION:: All SQL in this RFD is for demonstration purposes, see the actual code
changes for the SQL.

The fundamental contribution of this proposal is that rather than locking being
an emergent behaviour of the state of the database, locks will be explicitly
stated and tracked in a table.

This proposal will:

. Implement the existing functionality.
. Add the `dest_branch` functionality.
. Provide a path for supporting locking driven by API requests, but not
explicitly implement it, just show that it is possible.
. Outline the path of migrating the current database to the new locking design.

=== Locks Table

The table containing all pull request locks will be the
`dirspace_pull_request_locks` table.  Each row in the table will correspond to a
dirspace and which pull request owns it.

The schema:

[source,sql]
----
create table dirspace_pull_request_locks_branch_targets (
    id text primary key
);

insert into dirspace_pull_request_locks_branch_targets (id) values
    ('all'),
    ('dest_branch');

create table dirspace_pull_request_locks (
    branch_target text not null,
    path text not null,
    pull_request uuid not null,
    workspace text not null,
    primary key (path, workspace, pull_request),
    foreign key (branch_target) references
    dirspace_pull_request_locks_branch_targets (id)
);

create index dirspace_pull_request_locks_pull_request_idx
    on dirspace_pull_request_locks (pull_request);

create view github_dirspace_pull_request_locks as
    select
        gprm.repository_id as repository,
        gprm.pull_number as pull_number,
        locks.path as path,
        locks.workspace as workspace,
        locks.branch_target as branch_target
    from dirspace_pull_request_locks as locks
    inner join githu_pull_requests_map as gprm
        on gprm.core_id = locks.pull_request;

alter table change_dirspaces
    add column branch_target text not null default ('all');

create or replace view github_change_dirspace as
    select
        cd.base_sha,
        cd.path,
        grm.repository_id AS repository,
        cd.sha,
        cd.workspace,
        cd.lock_policy,
        cd.branch_target
   from change_dirspaces as cd
   inner join github_repositories_map as grm
       on cd.repo = grm.core_id;

create or replace view gitlab_change_dirspaces as
    select
        cd.base_sha,
        cd.path,
        grm.repository_id AS repository,
        cd.sha,
        cd.workspace,
        cd.lock_policy
   from change_dirspaces as cd
   inner join gitlab_repositories_map as grm
       on cd.repo = grm.core_id;

=== Maintaining the table

With locks being explicit, it is important that the table is accurate.  To
accomplish this we will have the following:

. A query which takes a pull request and constructs all rows which should be
present in the `dirspace_pull_request_locks` table, deleting those rows which
should not be there.
. A trigger on pull request update which runs the query.
. A trigger on work manifest completion which runs the query.

In this way, pull requests are capable of knowing which, if any, dirspace they
have a lock on or not.  Because pull requests are updated fairly infrequently,
this achieves our goal of reducing the cost of querying locks.

This function, when given a github repository and pull request, will update any
locks for the GitHub.

This function can be used with minor changes for GitLab and future VCS
providers.

With this table and triggers the following semantics are maintained:

. When a pull request is made, the trigger is run and the locks table is not
updated.
. When a pull request is updated, the trigger is run and locks table is updated
if the update impacts locks (for example if the pull request is merged).
. When a work manifest is completed the trigger is run and updates the lock
table.  This could create locks (for example if the work manifest is an apply
and not all does not complete dirspaces, or it could delete the locks if the
work manifest completes applying all dirspaces).

There is one other consideration which impacts locks which is addressed next,
which is unlocking.

=== Unlocking

Terrateam provides an unlocking mechanism that allows someone to explicitly
state that any locks associated with a change should be disregarded.  Unlock
actually covers more than just owning dirspaces.  A work manifest that is stuck
in a `running` state can be reset via `unlock` as well.  This work manifest
would not actually impact locking if it is a plan operation but still impacts
other operations.  So `unlock` is a bit of a catch-all for "whatever state I'm
in, throw it away and start from scratch".

Unlocking is implemented by updating an append-only table called
`pull_request_unlocks` which is then queried and compared to the date of any
operation to see if it the operation should be considered.

In this case, we will modify the semantics of unlocking in the following ways:

. Currently when a work manifest is in `running` state and an `unlock` is
performed, the work manifest's state is not updated but rather the existence of
the unlock row indicates that the work manifest should be disregarded.  Now when
an unlock is performed, all running work manifests which are impacted by it will
have their state changed from `running` to `aborted`.
. When an unlock is performed, all rows in the `dirspaces_pull_request_locks`
table impacted by it will be deleted.

In this iteration, we will use a trigger for inserts into the unlock table to
signal performing these operations, however we will not modify any uses of the
unlock table for now and slowly migrate away from using the unlock table.

=== Dirspace locks view

We will make a view of the dirspace locks table for GitHub (and GitLab) which is
more easily queried for the particular VCS.

The views will be named: `${vcs}_dirspace_pull_request_locks`.

=== Querying locks

With these changes, the expensive query determining if other pull requests own a
dirspace can be replaced with:

[source,sql]
----
select
    dsprl.path as path,
    dsprl.workspace as workspace,
    gpr.base_branch as base_branch,
    gpr.branch as branch_name,
    gpr.base_sha as bash_hash,
    gpr.sha as hash,
    gpr.merged_sha as merged_hash,
    gpr.merged_at as merged_at,
    gpr.pull_number as id,
    gpr.state as state,
    gpr.title as title,
    gpr.username as username
from github_dirspace_pull_request_locks as dsprl
inner join github_pull_requests as gpr
    on dsprl.repository = gpr.repository
inner join github_pull_requests as our_pr
    on our_pr.repository = gpr.repository
where our_pr.repository = $repository
      and our_pr.pull_number = $pull_number
      and gpr.pull_number <> our_pr.pull_number
      and dsprl.path = any($dirs)
      and dsprl.workspace = any($workspaces)
      and (dsprl.branch_target = 'all'
           or (dsprl.branch_target = 'dest_branch'
               and our_pr.base_branch = gpr.base_branch))

== Migration

Migrating to this will be implemented over the following phases:

. Introduce tables plus triggers.  This gets the tracking of locks going as we
begin to transition over.
** Add dirspace locking table.
** Add triggers to maintain table.
. Incrementally migrate over.  This is necessary for SaaS because the amount of
pull request to check locks on is too expensive to do in on step.  We add some
code to the server to do it in a loop.
** Add a table to track which pull requests have been migrated to new locking.
** Insert all pull requests into tracking table.
** Add migration code to run in the server (not during migration) to batch-based
   migration.
. After completion of incremental migration, support large batch migration.
This is necessary for users who are self-hosted.  This will consume any elements
in the migration table created in the previous step.
** Remove the server code to run the incremental migration.
** Add migration script to do the equivalent of the incremental migration but in
   one big run (for SaaS this will be a noop, for other users this will be a
   big batch operation).
** Remove big query to test for locking and replace with query using the
   dirspaces table.
. Clean up
** Drop the migration table.
