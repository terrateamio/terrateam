description: The engine configuration reference
---

The `engine` configuration allows you to specify which tool should be used for executing plan and apply operations. Terrateam supports multiple tools, including Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Pulumi, CDKTF, and custom engines. This configuration can be defined globally or overridden per workflow by including it under the `workflows` key.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
engine:
  name: terraform
  tf_version: latest
  tf_cmd: terraform
```

## Keys
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| name | String | The name of the tool to use for executing Terraform operations. Can be `terraform`, `tofu`, `terragrunt`, `cdktf`, or `custom`. Default is `terraform`. |
| version | String | The version of the tool to use. Only applies to `terraform`, `tofu`, and `terragrunt`. This value is overridden by any version information specified in the Terraform or OpenTofu code. Default is `latest`. |
| tf_version | String | The version of the Terraform or OpenTofu CLI to use when `engine.name` is set to `terragrunt` or `cdktf`. Default is `latest`. |
| tf_cmd | String | The command to use for `terragrunt` or `cdktf` executions. Can be `terraform` or `tofu`. Default is `terraform`. |
| init | Array | *(Custom engine only)* The command to run during the init step. Optional. |
| plan | Array | *(Custom engine only)* The command to run during the plan step. Must write to the path specified by the `TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE` environment variable. Required. |
| diff | Array | *(Custom engine only)* The command to produce a human-readable diff of the plan output. Optional. |
| apply | Array | *(Custom engine only)* The command to run during the apply step. Optional. |
| outputs | Array | *(Custom engine only)* The command to return output values as a JSON string. Optional. |

## Examples
### Using Terraform
```yaml
engine:
  name: terraform
  version: 1.0.0
```

### Using OpenTofu
```yaml
engine:
  name: tofu
  version: 1.9.0
```

### Using Terragrunt with a Specific Terraform Version
```yaml
engine:
  name: terragrunt
  tf_version: 1.11.1
```

### Using Terragrunt with OpenTofu
```yaml
engine:
  name: terragrunt
  tf_cmd: tofu
```

### Using CDKTF with the Latest Terraform Version
```yaml
engine:
  name: cdktf
```

### Using Pulumi
```yaml
engine:
  name: pulumi
```

### Using a Custom Engine
```yaml
engine:
  name: custom
  init: ['echo', 'init']
  plan: ['touch', '$TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE']
  diff: ['printf', '+ added foo\n- removed bar\n~ updated baz\n']
  apply: ['cat', 'foo.txt']
  outputs: ['echo', '{"foo": "bar"}']
```
This configuration defines a fully custom engine using shell commands for each step.

## Considerations
When configuring `engine`, keep the following in mind:
- The `terraform` engine is the default and most commonly used option. It directly uses the Terraform CLI for executing Terraform operations.
- The `tofu` engine uses OpenTofu, an open-source reimplementation of the Terraform CLI. It provides additional features and enhancements over the standard Terraform CLI.
- The `terragrunt` engine uses Terragrunt, a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state.
- The `cdktf` engine uses CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform), which allows you to define your infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java.
- When using `terragrunt` or `cdktf`, you can specify the version of Terraform or OpenTofu CLI to use with the `tf_version` option. This allows you to control the underlying Terraform version independently of the Terragrunt or CDKTF version.
- The `custom` engine allows full control over each step in the pipeline. You may specify only the steps relevant to your use case. For `plan`, you must write output to `TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE`. The `outputs` step must return valid JSON.
