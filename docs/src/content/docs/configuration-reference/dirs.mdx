title: dirs
description: The dirs configuration reference
---

The `dirs` configuration can be used to describe which [tag queries](/advanced-workflows/tags), workspaces, and [when modified](/configuration-reference/when-modified) rules apply to a directory in your repository.

## Default Configuration

```yaml
dirs: {}
```

## Keys

Each directory consists of the directory's name as a key and a map as a value. The map has the following attributes:
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| create_and_select_workspace | boolean | Create and select the workspace defined in the workspaces configuration. Default is true. |
| lock_branch_target | string | Defines when using `destination_branches` if this directory should be locked on a per-destination branch bases or all branches.  `all` means that if two pull requests modify the same workspace, their locks will conflict with each other based on the destination branch name.  `dest_branch` means that only pull requests modifying the same workspace targeting the same destination branch will conflict.  Default is `all`. |
| tags | list | List of tags to assign the directory. |
| workspaces | object | Workspace configuration. |
| when_modified | when_modified | Configuration to override when to match pull request file changes with autoplan and autoapply. |

## Example Configuration

Here is an example of how directories might be configured:


```yaml
dirs:
  ec2:
    tags: [aws, ec2]
    workspaces:
      production:
        tags: [production]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["ec2/*.tf", "ec2/*.tfvars", "iam/*.tf", "iam/*.tfvars"]
  iam:
    tags: [aws, iam]
```

## Directory Configuration

### Create and Select Workspace
The `create_and_select_workspace` key is used to specify whether to select and create the workspace defined in the `workspaces` configuration.
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| create_and_select_workspace | boolean | Select and create the workspace defined in the workspaces configuration. Default is true. |

### Tags
The `tags` key is used to create a custom tag for a directory. When assigning [tags](/advanced-workflows/tags)  to a directory, tag values can be used in any combination to trigger workflows or target resources with a tag query.
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tags | list | List of tags to assign the directory. |

#### Implicit Tags

##### **`dir:<name>`**
Each directory automatically receives a `dir:<name>` tag, where `<name>` is the path of the directory without a trailing `/`.

##### **`workspace:<name>`**
Each workspace automatically receives a `workspace:<name>` tag, where `<name>` is the name of the workspace.

### Workspaces
The `workspaces` configuration is an object where the object key is the name of the workspace and the value is its configuration. Each workspace can have its own:
- Custom tags for targeting specific workspace operations
- `when_modified` configuration to override directory or global settings

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| workspaces | object | Workspace configuration. |
| workspaces.\<name\>.tags | list | List of tags to assign to the workspace. |
| workspaces.\<name\>.when_modified | object | Workspace-specific when_modified configuration. |

#### Example
```yaml
dirs:
  infrastructure:
    tags: [aws]  # Directory-level tag
    workspaces:
      production:
        tags: [critical, prod]  # Workspace-specific tags
        when_modified:
          file_patterns: ["${DIR}/*.tf", "shared/*.tf", "modules/*.tf"]
          autoplan: true
          autoapply: true
      staging:
        tags: [non-critical, staging]  # Different tags for staging
        when_modified:
          file_patterns: ["${DIR}/*.tf", "shared/*.tf"]  
          autoplan: true
          autoapply: false  # No auto-apply for staging
```

This example demonstrates:
- Directory-level tags (`aws`) apply to all workspaces
- Each workspace has its own tags (`critical`/`prod` vs `non-critical`/`staging`)
- Each workspace has custom `when_modified` rules (production is triggered by more file patterns and has auto-apply enabled)

### When Modified
The `when_modified` configuration can be set at multiple levels within the `dirs` directive:

1. **Directory level**: `dirs.<directory>.when_modified` - Applies to ALL workspaces within that directory, overriding the global `when_modified` settings
2. **Workspace level**: `dirs.<directory>.workspaces.<workspace>.when_modified` - The most specific level, applies only to that individual workspace, overriding both global and directory-level settings

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| when_modified | object | Configuration to override when to match pull request file changes with autoplan and autoapply. |

#### Configuration Hierarchy
- The `when_modified` configuration syntax is identical across all levels (global, directory, and workspace)
- More specific configurations override broader ones: workspace > directory > global
- Individual keys can be overridden at each level (e.g., you can set only `autoapply: true` at the workspace level while other settings come from higher levels)
- The `file_patterns` default value is set to the path of the directory specified in the `dirs` object
- The `file_patterns` list is always relative to the root of the repository
- The `${DIR}` variable specified in `file_patterns` is always relative to the root of the repository and can be used to specify the directory that Terrateam is working against

#### Examples

##### Directory-Level Configuration
```yaml
dirs:
  foobar:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["${DIR}/*.tf"]
```

This triggers a Terrateam plan operation when `foobar/*.tf` is modified in a pull request.

##### Workspace-Level Configuration
```yaml
dirs:
  foobar:
    workspaces:
      production:
        when_modified:
          file_patterns: ["${DIR}/*.tf", "shared/*.tf"]
          autoplan: true
          autoapply: true
      staging:
        when_modified:
          file_patterns: ["${DIR}/*.tf"]
          autoplan: true
          autoapply: false
```

This example shows different `when_modified` configurations for production and staging workspaces within the same directory. The production workspace will autoplan and autoapply when either directory-specific or shared files change, while staging will only autoplan (not autoapply).

## Globs
The `dirs` directive supports glob patterns, which can be useful for repositories with a lot of directories that match a pattern with a similar configuration.
### Example

Consider a repository with the following files:

- `_templates/ec2/terragrunt.hcl`
- `prod/ec2/us-east-1/foo.tf`
- `prod/ec2/us-west-1/foo.tf`
- `prod/ebs/us-east-1/foo.tf`
- `prod/ebs/us-west-1/foo.tf`
- `.terrateam/config.yml`:

```yaml
dirs:
  _templates/**:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
  prod/**/ec2/**:
    tags: [prod, ec2]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "${DIR}/*.tf"]
  prod/**:
    tags: [prod]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "${DIR}/*.tf"]
```
Given the file list, the following `dirs` directive will be automatically generated during every Terrateam operation:


```yaml
dirs:
  _templates/ec2:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
  prod/ec2/us-east-1:
    tags: [prod, ec2]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "prod/ec2/us-east-1/*.tf"]
  prod/ec2/us-west-1:
    tags: [prod, ec2]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "prod/ec2/us-west-1/*.tf"]
  prod/ebs/us-east-1:
    tags: [prod]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "prod/ebs/us-east-1/*.tf"]
  prod/ebs/us-west-1:
    tags: [prod]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["_templates/**/*.tf", "prod/ebs/us-west-1/*.tf"]
```

### Longest Glob Match
In the example above, the files in the `prod/ec2` directory match two globs:
- `prod/**/ec2/**`
- `prod/**`

The glob `prod/**/ec2/**` is longer than `prod/**` and is considered the better match because the glob is more specific.
### Directory Globs Match Files (Terragrunt)
Globs can be expressed all the way to the file level. The directory of the file is then taken when constructing the `dirs` directory.
For example, in a repository with a structure to be used with Terragrunt, one could have the following configuration:


```yaml showLineNumbers=true
dirs:
  _templates/**/terragrunt.hcl:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
  "**/terragrunt.hcl":
    tags: [terragrunt]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ['_templates/**/terragrunt.hcl', '${DIR}/*.hcl', '${DIR}/*.tf', '${DIR}/*.tfvars']
```

This configuration would apply the following rules:

- Lines 2-4: Disable Terrateam operations in any directory under the `_templates/` directory with a `terragrunt.hcl` file.
- Lines 5-8: Run Terrateam operations against a directory when:
  - The directory contains a `terragrunt.hcl` file.
  - The pull request changed files ending in `hcl`, `tf`, or `tfvars`.
  - The pull request changed files include a `terragrunt.hcl` file in the `_templates/` directory.

Longest glob wins.

## Best Practices
- Assign tags to specific directories.
- Configure workspaces for specific directories.
- Override `when_modified` rules for specific directories.
- Use globs to match multiple directories with similar configurations.
- Use the `${DIR}` variable to reference the current directory in file patterns.
