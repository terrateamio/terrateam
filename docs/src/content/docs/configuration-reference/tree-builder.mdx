description: The tree_builder configuration reference
---

The `tree_builder` configuration allows you to customize how Terrateam discovers and tracks files in your repository. Instead of relying solely on Git's file tree and change detection, you can use a custom script to define which files should be considered and whether they have changed.

## Default Configuration

```yaml
tree_builder:
  enabled: false
```

## Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enabled | Boolean | Specifies whether the tree builder is enabled. Default is false. |
| script | String | The script to execute for building the file tree. The script should output JSON to stdout. This key must be set when `enabled` is true. |

## Script Behavior

When `tree_builder` is enabled, Terrateam executes your custom script during the workflow evaluation process. The script analyzes your repository and outputs a JSON structure defining which files should be tracked and their change status.

### Output

The script must output valid JSON to stdout with the following structure

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file1.tf",
      "changed": true
    },
    {
      "path": "path/to/file2.tf", 
      "changed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| files | Array | Yes | Array of file objects |
| files[].path | String | Yes | Relative path from repository root |
| files[].changed | Boolean | No | Whether the file has changed (defaults to true if omitted) |
| files[].id | String | No | Optional unique identifier for the file |
