The `storage` configuration allows users to define where plan files are stored, providing control over security and access. By default, plan files are stored on the Terrateam server, but alternative methods are supported.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
storage:
  plans:
    method: terrateam
```

## Storage Methods
The `method` key specifies how plans are stored:

### S3-compatible Storage

| Key | Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| bucket | String | Bucket to store plans. Supports environment variables. Required. | 
| region | String | Region where the bucket resides. Supports environment variables. Required. | 
| path | String | Path to store plans within the bucket. Defaults to terrateam/plans/$dir/$workspace/$date-$time-$token. See template variables for details. | 
| access_key_id | String | Access key ID for authentication. Supports environment variables. Optional. | 
| secret_access_key | String | Secret access key for authentication. Supports environment variables. Optional. | 
| delete_used_plans | Boolean | Delete plan after use. Default is true. | 
| store_extra_args | List | Additional arguments for aws s3 cp during storage. Optional. | 
| fetch_extra_args | List | Additional arguments for aws s3 cp during fetching. Optional. | 
| delete_extra_args | List | Additional arguments for aws s3 rm during deletion. Optional. | 

### Custom Command Storage
For custom commands to store, fetch, and delete plans, configure:
| Key | Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| delete | String list | Command to delete the plan after use. Supports environment and template variables. Optional. | 
| fetch | String list | Command to fetch the plan. Supports environment and template variables. Required. | 
| store | String list | Command to store the plan. Supports environment and template variables. Required. | 

## Template Variables
Variables available during plan and apply operations:
| Variable | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| date | Date of the plan operation in YYYY-MM-DD format. | 
| dir | Directory being processed, e.g., foo/bar/baz. | 
| plan_path | Path on disk where the plan is stored. | 
| plan_dst_path | Destination path on disk for fetched plans. | 
| time | Time of the plan operation in HHMMSS format. |

## Examples
### Storing Plans in AWS S3
```yaml
storage:
  plans:
    method: s3
    bucket: my-plan-bucket
    region: us-west-2
    access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Custom Commands for Plan Storage
```yaml
storage:
  plans:
    method: cmd
    store: ['gsutil', 'cp', '$plan_path', 'gs://my-plan-bucket/terrateam/plans/$dir/$workspace/$date-$time-$token']
    fetch: ['gsutil', 'cp', 'gs://my-plan-bucket/terrateam/plans/$dir/$workspace/$date-$time-$token', '$plan_dst_path']
    delete: ['gsutil', 'rm', 'gs://my-plan-bucket/terrateam/plans/$dir/$workspace/$date-$time-$token']
```
