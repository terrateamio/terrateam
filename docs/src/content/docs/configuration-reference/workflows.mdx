description: The workflows configuration reference
---

The `workflows` configuration allows you to customize the steps executed during a Terraform operation, replacing the default workflow. This feature enables you to tailor the behavior of Terrateam to better suit your specific use case and requirements.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    environment: null
    lock_policy: "strict"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```

## Keys
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| environment | String | The GitHub Environment to associate the workflow with. Default is null. |
| runs_on | Object | Object describing the runs-on configuration.  Default is `ubuntu-latest`. |
| lock_policy | String | When the directory should have a lock acquired. Values are strict (acquire a lock if either it is merged or applied), apply (only acquire a lock when it is applied), merge (only acquire a lock when it is merged), and none (never acquire a lock). Default is strict. |

### Tag Query
A [tag query](/advanced-workflows/tags) is a list of all tags that must be present in a tag set to match the workflow.
Each `tag_query` consists of a map with the following attributes:
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| plan | `plan` | `plan` steps. |
| apply | `apply` | `apply` steps. |
| terragrunt | Boolean | Override the `terraform` command with `terragrunt`. Default is `false`. |
| lock_policy | String | When the directory should have a lock acquired. Values are `strict` (acquire a lock if either it is merged or applied), `apply` (only acquire a lock when it is applied), `merge` (only acquire a lock when it is merged), and `none` (never acquire a lock). Default is `strict`. |
| engine | [Engine](/configuration-reference/engine) | Configuration to override which engine to use for operations. |
| environment | String | GitHub environment to use for the operation. Default is `null`. |
:::note
Be careful when modifying `lock_policy`. Any value other than `strict` is considered less safe, but can be useful in the right situation.

## Workflow Steps
Workflows consist of a series of steps that are executed in order. The available step types are:
- `init`: Runs `terraform init`.
- `plan`: Runs `terraform plan`.
- `apply`: Runs `terraform apply`.
- `env`: Sets environment variables.
- `run`: Runs a custom command.
- `oidc`: Initiates an OIDC connection to a cloud provider.

### Plan
Plan steps are defined under the `plan` key in a workflow.

## Examples
### Setting an Environment Variable with a Command
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:prod"
    plan:
      - type: env
        name: MY_CUSTOM_VAR
        cmd: ['echo', 'Hello, World!']
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'The value of MY_CUSTOM_VAR is: $MY_CUSTOM_VAR']
```
### Setting Environment Variables Using the Source Method
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:prod"
    plan:
      - type: env
        method: source
        cmd: ['$TERRATEAM_ROOT/scripts/environment']
      - type: init
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: env
        method: source
        cmd: ['$TERRATEAM_ROOT/scripts/environment']
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```
This workflow matches any directories tagged with `dir:prod` and:
1. Executes the `environment` script to export environment variables.
2. Runs `terraform init` for both plan and apply.
3. Runs `terraform plan` with the environment variables set by the `environment` script.
4. Executes the `environment` script again to export environment variables before applying.
5. Runs `terraform apply` with the environment variables set by the `environment` script.

### Custom Plan and Apply Steps
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:production"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Running custom plan step']
      - type: plan
        extra_args: ['-input=false']
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
        extra_args: ['-auto-approve']
      - type: run
        cmd: ['./post_apply_script.sh']
```
This workflow matches any directories tagged with `dir:production` and:
1. Runs `terraform init` for both plan and apply.
2. Echoes a custom message before running `terraform plan`.
3. Runs `terraform plan` with the `-input=false` flag.
4. Runs `terraform apply` with the `-auto-approve` flag.
5. Runs a custom script after applying changes.

### AWS OIDC Authentication
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:aws"
    plan:
      - type: oidc
        provider: aws
        role_arn: ${AWS_ROLE_ARN}
      - type: init
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: oidc
        provider: aws
        role_arn: ${AWS_ROLE_ARN}
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```
This workflow matches any directories tagged with `dir:aws` and:
1. Initiates an OIDC connection to AWS using the role ARN specified in the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` environment variable for both plan and apply.
2. Runs `terraform init` for both plan and apply.
3. Runs `terraform plan`.
4. Runs `terraform apply`.

### GCP OIDC Authentication
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:gcp"
    plan:
      - type: oidc
        provider: gcp
        service_account: ${GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
        workload_identity_provider: ${GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER}
      - type: init
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: oidc
        provider: gcp
        service_account: ${GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
        workload_identity_provider: ${GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER}
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```
This workflow matches any directories tagged with `dir:gcp` and:
1. Initiates an OIDC connection to GCP using the service account and workload identity provider specified in the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` and `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` environment variables for both plan and apply.
2. Runs `terraform init` for both plan and apply.
3. Runs `terraform plan`.
4. Runs `terraform apply`.

### Specifying a GitHub Environment
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: production
    environment: production
```

This workflow will run using the `production` GitHub Environment, ensuring that the secrets and variables defined in the `production` environment are accessible.

## Considerations
When configuring and using workflows in Terrateam, keep the following considerations in mind:
- Be cautious when modifying the default workflow steps, such as removing the `init` or `plan` steps, as this can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that your custom workflows include all the necessary steps for a successful Terraform operation.
- When defining custom steps using the `run` step type, make sure that the specified command or script is available and executable within the Terrateam environment. Consider using absolute paths or ensuring that the necessary dependencies are installed.
- If your custom steps require specific environment variables, use the `env` step type with the `source` method to set them before the relevant steps. Be mindful of the order in which environment variables are set and used within the workflow.
- When using the `source` method for setting environment variables, ensure that the executed script or command properly exports the desired variables. Test the script independently to verify that it generates the expected environment variables.
- Consider the security implications of using the `capture_output` option with the `run` step type, as it may expose sensitive information in the GitHub pull request comment if the command fails. Ensure that you properly sanitize or mask any sensitive data before enabling this option.
- Consider using Terrateam's built-in environment variables (e.g., `TERRATEAM_DIR`, `TERRATEAM_WORKSPACE`) within your workflows to make them more dynamic and reusable across different directories and workspaces.
