---

The `workflows` configuration allows you to customize the steps executed during a Terraform operation, replacing the default workflow. This feature enables you to tailor the behavior of Terrateam to better suit your specific use case and requirements.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    environment: null
    lock_policy: "strict"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```

## Keys
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| environment | String | The GitHub Environment to associate the workflow with. Default is null. |
| runs_on | Object | Object describing the runs-on configuration.  Default is `ubuntu-latest`. |
| lock_policy | String | When the directory should have a lock acquired. Values are strict (acquire a lock if either it is merged or applied), apply (only acquire a lock when it is applied), merge (only acquire a lock when it is merged), and none (never acquire a lock). Default is strict. |

### Tag Query
A [tag query](/advanced-workflows/tags) is a list of all tags that must be present in a tag set to match the workflow.
Each `tag_query` consists of a map with the following attributes:
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| plan | `plan` | `plan` steps. |
| apply | `apply` | `apply` steps. |
| terragrunt | Boolean | Override the `terraform` command with `terragrunt`. Default is `false`. |
| lock_policy | String | When the directory should have a lock acquired. Values are `strict` (acquire a lock if either it is merged or applied), `apply` (only acquire a lock when it is applied), `merge` (only acquire a lock when it is merged), and `none` (never acquire a lock). Default is `strict`. |
| engine | [Engine](/configuration-reference/engine) | Configuration to override which engine to use for operations. |
| environment | String | GitHub environment to use for the operation. Default is `null`. |
:::note
Be careful when modifying `lock_policy`. Any value other than `strict` is considered less safe, but can be useful in the right situation.

## Workflow Steps
Workflows consist of a series of steps that are executed in order. The available step types are:
- `init`: Runs `terraform init`.
- `plan`: Runs `terraform plan`.
- `apply`: Runs `terraform apply`.
- `env`: Sets environment variables.
- `run`: Runs a custom command.
- `oidc`: Initiates an OIDC connection to a cloud provider.
- `checkov`: Runs Checkov security scanning on the Terraform plan.
- `conftest`: Runs Conftest policy validation on the Terraform plan.

### Plan
Plan steps are defined under the `plan` key in a workflow.
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| type | String | Terrateam step type: `init`, `plan`, `env`, `run`, `oidc`, `checkov`, `conftest`. |
| extra_args | List | Extra command line arguments passed to the `terraform` command. |

### Apply
Apply steps are defined under the `apply` key in a workflow.
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| type | String | Terrateam step type: `init`, `apply`, `env`, `run`, `oidc`. |

### Env
Environment variables can be set two ways:
- Using the `env` type combined with a `cmd`.
- Using the `env` type combined with a `cmd` and `method` set to `source`.

#### Command
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| name | String | Environment variable name. |
| cmd | List | Command to execute that exports and environment variable. |
| trim_trailing_newlines | Boolean | Trim trailing newlines. Default is true. |
| sensitive | Boolean | Specify if the value of the environment variable is sensitive.  It will be masked in all output. Default: `false`. |

#### Source Method
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| method | String | Must be set to `source`. |
| cmd | List | Command or script to execute that exports environment variables. |
| sensitive | Boolean | Indicates whether the environment variables modified by the script are sensitive. If true, they will be masked in all output. Default: `false`. |

### Run
Custom commands can be run using the `run` step type.
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| cmd | List | Command to run from the directory that Terrateam is operating against. |
| run_on | String | Run the command depending on the state of the workflow.  Options are `success`, `failure`, or `always`. Default is `success`. |
| capture_output | Boolean | When set to `true`, command output is recorded.  Secrets are masked with `***`.  Default is `true`. |
| env | Object | Environment variables to set for this execution. Object keys are environment variable names and the value is a string. |
| ignore_errors | Boolean | Set to `true` if failure should be ignored.  Default is `false.` |
| visible_on | String | When the output of the command should be visible in a PR comment or the UI.  Options are `always`, `failure`, `success`.  Default is `failure`. |
| gate | Object | Gate configuration for manual approval if the command fails (see Gate section below) |

### Checkov
Runs Checkov security scanning against the generated Terraform plan to detect misconfigurations and security issues.

The `checkov` step type automatically:
- Executes Checkov against the Terraform plan file
- Captures and includes the output in the Terrateam results
- Fails the workflow if critical issues are detected

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| type | String | Must be `checkov` |
| extra_args | List | Extra command line arguments passed to the checkov command |
| gate | Object | Gate configuration for manual approval if Checkov fails (see Gate section below) |

Configuration is done through environment variables. Common Checkov environment variables include:
- `CKV_SKIP_CHECK`: Comma-separated list of check IDs to skip
- `CKV_CHECK`: Comma-separated list of specific check IDs to run
- `CKV_FRAMEWORK`: Specify framework to scan (default: terraform_plan)

For a full list of configuration options, see the [Checkov documentation](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html).

### Conftest
Runs Conftest policy validation using Open Policy Agent (OPA) against the generated Terraform plan.

The `conftest` step type automatically:
- Executes Conftest against the Terraform plan file using Rego policies
- Captures and includes the output in the Terrateam results
- Fails the workflow if policies are violated

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| type | String | Must be `conftest` |
| extra_args | List | Extra command line arguments passed to the conftest command |
| gate | Object | Gate configuration for manual approval if Conftest fails (see Gate section below) |

By default, Conftest looks for policies in the `policy/` directory relative to the Terraform configuration. This can be customized using the `CONFTEST_POLICY` environment variable.

Common Conftest environment variables include:
- `CONFTEST_POLICY`: Path to the directory containing Rego policy files
- `CONFTEST_NAMESPACE`: Namespace to use for policy evaluation (default: main)
- `CONFTEST_OUTPUT`: Output format (json, table, tap, junit, github)

For more information on writing policies and configuration options, see the [Conftest documentation](https://www.conftest.dev/).

### Gate
The `gate` configuration allows you to require manual approval when certain workflow steps fail, particularly useful for security scanning, policy checks, and custom validation scripts. When a gated step fails, instead of immediately failing the workflow, Terrateam creates an approval request that authorized users can approve to continue the workflow.

Gates are supported on the following step types:
- `run`: Gate custom command failures
- `checkov`: Gate security scan failures
- `conftest`: Gate policy violations

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| token | String | A unique identifier for this gate request |
| name | String | A name to give to the gate |
| all_of | List | List of users/teams that must all approve the gate |
| any_of | List | List of users/teams where any one can approve the gate |
| any_of_count | Integer | Number of approvals required from the `any_of` list (default: 1) |

To approve a gate, authorized users can comment:
```
terrateam gate approve <token>
```

### OIDC
An OIDC connection to a cloud provider can be initiated using the `oidc` step type, which supports AWS and GCP providers.
| Key | Type | Provider | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| oidc | List | | Initiate an OIDC connection to a cloud provider. |
| provider | String | | Name of provider: `aws` or `gcp`. |
| role_arn | String | aws | Specifies the ARN of an IAM role that you want to use. Value can be specified using a GitHub Secret / environment variable with `${ENV_VAR}`. |

2. Runs `terraform init` for both plan and apply.
3. Runs `terraform plan`.
4. Runs `terraform apply`.

### Security Scanning with Checkov
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: checkov
```
This workflow runs Checkov security scanning after generating the Terraform plan to detect misconfigurations and security issues.

### Policy Validation with Conftest
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: conftest
```
This workflow runs Conftest policy validation after generating the Terraform plan to ensure compliance with your organization's policies.

### Combined Security and Policy Checks
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "env:production"
    plan:
      - type: env
        name: CKV_SKIP_CHECK
        cmd: ['echo', 'CKV_AWS_20,CKV_AWS_23']
      - type: env

        cmd: ['echo', '$TERRATEAM_ROOT/policies/production/']
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: checkov
      - type: conftest
```
This workflow for production environments:
1. Sets Checkov to skip specific checks
2. Configures Conftest to use production-specific policies
3. Runs both security scanning and policy validation

### Using Gates for Manual Approval
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "env:production"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: checkov
        gate:
          token: "checkov-override"
          any_of: ["team:security", "team:platform"]
      - type: conftest
        gate:
          token: "policy-override"
          all_of: ["team:compliance"]
          any_of: ["user:cto", "user:security-lead"]
```
This workflow allows security or platform team members to approve Checkov failures, and requires both compliance team approval and either CTO or security lead approval for Conftest policy violations.

### Gating Custom Validation Scripts
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: run
        cmd: ['./scripts/cost-check.sh']
        gate:
          token: "cost-approval"
          any_of: ["team:finance", "user:budget-owner"]
          any_of_count: 1
```
This workflow runs a custom cost validation script and allows finance team members or the budget owner to approve if costs exceed thresholds.

### Specifying a GitHub Environment
```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: production
    environment: production
```

This workflow will run using the `production` GitHub Environment, ensuring that the secrets and variables defined in the `production` environment are accessible.

## Considerations
When configuring and using workflows in Terrateam, keep the following considerations in mind:
- Be cautious when modifying the default workflow steps, such as removing the `init` or `plan` steps, as this can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that your custom workflows include all the necessary steps for a successful Terraform operation.
- When defining custom steps using the `run` step type, make sure that the specified command or script is available and executable within the Terrateam environment. Consider using absolute paths or ensuring that the necessary dependencies are installed.
- If your custom steps require specific environment variables, use the `env` step type with the `source` method to set them before the relevant steps. Be mindful of the order in which environment variables are set and used within the workflow.
- When using the `source` method for setting environment variables, ensure that the executed script or command properly exports the desired variables. Test the script independently to verify that it generates the expected environment variables.
- Consider the security implications of using the `capture_output` option with the `run` step type, as it may expose sensitive information in the GitHub pull request comment if the command fails. Ensure that you properly sanitize or mask any sensitive data before enabling this option.
- Consider using Terrateam's built-in environment variables (e.g., `TERRATEAM_DIR`, `TERRATEAM_WORKSPACE`) within your workflows to make them more dynamic and reusable across different directories and workspaces.
