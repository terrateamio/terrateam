description: Free-form section of configuration for YAML anchors
---

The `definitions` configuration is a section of the configuration that can be any valid YAML.  It is useful for defining YAML Anchors which can then be applied to other parts of the configuration.

## Examples
### Default engine configuration
```yaml
definitions:
  default_engine: &default_engine
    name: tofu

engine: *default_engine
```
