---

Docker Compose provides the quickest way to get Terrateam Self-Hosted up and running. The included setup wizard automates the entire app creation process for both GitHub and GitLab, making deployment simple and error-free.

## What the Setup Wizard Does

The Terrateam setup wizard is a containerized application that handles all the complex configuration automatically for your chosen version control system:

### For GitHub
- **Automated GitHub App Creation**: Creates a GitHub App with all required permissions
- **OAuth Configuration**: Sets up webhook endpoints and OAuth settings
- **Secure Credentials**: Generates private keys and webhook secrets
- **Callback URLs**: Configures proper callback URLs for your deployment

### For GitLab
- **Personal Access Token Setup**: Guides you through PAT configuration
- **Project Integration**: Configures GitLab project webhooks
- **API Access**: Sets up proper API endpoints and authentication
- **Webhook Configuration**: Establishes secure webhook communication

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- For GitHub: Admin permissions in your GitHub organization
- For GitLab: Admin access to your GitLab group/project
- Port 3000 available on your local machine

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam.git
cd terrateam/docker/terrat
```

### Step 2: Start the Setup Wizard

```sh

```

The setup container will start and be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Complete the Setup Wizard

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Get Started" on the welcome screen
3. **Select your VCS** - Choose between GitHub and GitLab
4. **Configure Tunnel** - Authenticate with your VCS provider
5. **Complete Setup**:
