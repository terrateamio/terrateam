title: Gatekeeper - Manual Approval Gates
description: Create manual approval gates for security scans, policy violations, and custom validations

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Gatekeeper allows you to create manual approval gates in your Terrateam workflows, enabling authorized users to override failures from security scans, policy checks, or custom validations. This is particularly useful when you need human judgment to determine if certain violations are acceptable given the context.

## Understanding Gatekeeper

When a gated workflow step fails (such as a security scan detecting issues or a policy check finding violations), instead of immediately failing the entire workflow, Gatekeeper:

1. Pauses the workflow execution
2. Creates an approval request with a unique token
3. Notifies authorized approvers
4. Waits for manual approval before continuing

This allows teams to maintain strict automated checks while providing flexibility for legitimate exceptions.

## How Gatekeeper Works

<Steps>
1. **A gated step fails**: A workflow step configured with a gate encounters a failure condition

2. **Approval request created**: Terrateam posts a comment in the pull request with:
   - Details about what failed
   - The gate token identifier
   - Who can approve the gate

3. **Authorized user reviews**: Team members review the failure and determine if it's acceptable

4. **Approval granted**: An authorized user comments with the approval command:
   ```
   terrateam gate approve <token>
   ```

5. **Workflow continues**: Once approved, the workflow proceeds as if the step had succeeded
</Steps>

## Configuring Gates

Gates can be added to the following workflow step types:
- `run`: Gate failures from custom scripts and commands
- `checkov`: Gate security scan violations
- `conftest`: Gate policy check failures

### Gate Configuration Options

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `token` | String | **Required**. A unique identifier for this gate request |
| `all_of` | List | List of users/teams that must ALL approve the gate |
| `any_of` | List | List of users/teams where ANY ONE can approve the gate |
| `any_of_count` | Integer | Number of approvals required from the `any_of` list (default: 1) |

### Authorization Patterns

Gatekeeper supports flexible authorization patterns:

**Single Approver**:
```yaml
gate:
  token: "security-override"
  any_of: ["user:security-lead"]
```

**Any Team Member**:
```yaml
gate:
  token: "platform-approval"
  any_of: ["team:platform", "team:sre"]
```

**Multiple Required Approvers**:
```yaml
gate:
  token: "critical-override"
  all_of: ["team:security", "team:compliance"]
```

**N-of-M Approvals**:
```yaml
gate:
  token: "cost-approval"
  any_of: ["user:cfo", "user:cto", "user:eng-director", "user:finance-lead"]
  any_of_count: 2
```

## Common Use Cases

:::caution
Gates provide a powerful override mechanism. Configure them carefully to maintain security while enabling flexibility.
:::

### Security Scan Overrides

Allow security teams to approve known false positives or accepted risks:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: checkov
        gate:
          token: "checkov-override"
          any_of: ["team:security", "team:platform"]
```

When Checkov detects issues, security or platform team members can review and approve if the findings are acceptable.

### Policy Exception Handling

Enable compliance teams to grant exceptions to policy violations:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "production"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: conftest
        gate:
          token: "policy-exception"
          all_of: ["team:compliance"]
          any_of: ["user:compliance-lead", "user:ciso"]
```

This requires both general compliance team approval and approval from either the compliance lead or CISO.

### Cost Threshold Approvals

Require finance approval when infrastructure changes exceed cost thresholds:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      - type: run
        cmd: ['./scripts/cost-check.sh']
        gate:
          token: "cost-threshold"
          any_of: ["team:finance", "user:budget-owner"]
```

If the cost check script fails (indicating costs exceed thresholds), finance team members can review and approve the changes.

### Multi-Stage Validation

Combine multiple gated checks with different approval requirements:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "production"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
      
      # Security scanning with override capability
      - type: checkov
        gate:
          token: "security-scan"
          any_of: ["team:security"]
      
      # Compliance validation with stricter approval
      - type: conftest
        gate:
          token: "compliance-check"
          all_of: ["team:compliance"]
          any_of: ["user:compliance-lead"]
      
      # Custom validation with multiple approvers required
      - type: run
        cmd: ['./scripts/validate-production.sh']
        gate:
          token: "prod-validation"
          any_of: ["team:platform", "team:sre", "team:devops"]
          any_of_count: 2
```
