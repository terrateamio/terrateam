## How Terrateam Works

Terrateam brings GitOps principles to Terraform workflows, making infrastructure changes visible, reviewable, and safe.

The following steps explain how Terrateam processes your Terraform changes:

<Steps>
1. **Create a Pull Request with Terraform Changes**

   When you create a pull request containing Terraform code changes, Terrateam automatically detects the modifications.
   
   ![Terrateam pull request](../../assets/nibbler-pull-request.png)

2. **Automatic Plan Operation**

   Terrateam automatically runs `terraform plan` and comments the results directly in your pull request, allowing team members to review the proposed changes.
   
   ![Terrateam plan](../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-plan.png)

3. **Apply When Ready**

   You can apply changes either before merging or after merging.
   
   ![Terrateam Apply](../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-apply.png)
