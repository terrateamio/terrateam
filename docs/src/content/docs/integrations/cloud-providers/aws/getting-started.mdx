To use Terrateam with AWS, you need to configure authentication and authorization between Terrateam and your AWS account. Choose the setup method that works best for your needs.

## Setup Options

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Static Credentials"
    description="Easiest to get started - Set up AWS access keys and secrets in GitHub. Perfect for quick testing, simple setups, and getting started with Terrateam."
    href="./static-credentials"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="OpenID Connect (OIDC)"
    description="Recommended for production - Secure, keyless authentication using GitHub's OIDC provider. Includes both automated and manual setup options."
    href="./oidc-setup"
  />
</CardGrid>

## What's Next?

Once you've configured AWS authentication, you'll be able to:

- Run `terrateam plan` to preview infrastructure changes
- Run `terrateam apply` to deploy infrastructure changes
- Use all of Terrateam's advanced features with your AWS resources

:::tip[Need help choosing?]
If you're just getting started with Terrateam, we recommend beginning with [static credentials](./static-credentials) as it's the quickest way to get up and running. You can always switch to OIDC later for enhanced security.
