The following steps on this page will help you to set up Terrateam, integrate it with GitHub, and run your first Terraform deployment in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Terrateam quickstart guide, make sure you have the following:

- **A GitHub account** to fork the Terrateam [demo repository](https://github.com/terrateam-demo/kick-the-tires).
- **GitHub Actions** enabled in your forked repository.
- **Administrator access** to install the Terrateam GitHub app.


## Demo Repository Workflow

To have an overview on how to use Terrateam, use the the Terrateam ready-to-use demo repository with pre-configured Terraform code. Follow these steps to quickly test Terrateam's capabilities.

/>

<Steps>
1. **Fork the Demo Repository**

   Click the link above to access our demo repository, then click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.

   On the "Create a new fork" screen, keep the default settings and click "Create fork".

2. **Install the Terrateam GitHub Application (if you haven't already)**

   Sign up for a Terrateam account and install the GitHub app. Then, select the organizations and repositories that contain your Terraform code.

   ![Install Terrateam](../../assets/demo-install-terrateam-2.png)
   
   Once the installation is complete, access your [Terrateam dashboard](https://app.terrateam.io/). If the setup was successful, your forked repository will be listed there.

   After installation, go to [your Terrateam dashboard](https://app.terrateam.io/). Your forked repository should appear there.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to its directory:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kick-the-tires.git
   cd kick-the-tires
   ```
   
   
4. **Create a New Branch**

   Create a branch to make your changes:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-branch
   ```
   
5. **Modify a Terraform File**

   Let's modify a file to test the workflow, changes are detected automatically. Open `staging/compute/main.tf` and change the instance name.
      
   ```hcl {5}
   module "staging_compute_instance" {
     source = "../../modules/compute"

     instance_count = 0
     instance_name  = "staging-instance-modified"
     instance_zone  = "us-central1-a"
     boot_disk_image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
     network_name    = "default"
   }
   ```
   
6. **Commit and Push Your Changes**

   Commit your changes and push them to your branch:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Testing Terrateam workflow"
   git push origin test-branch
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/src/content/docs/quickstart-guide.mdx
   Access your forked repository on GitHub. A prompt should appear, allowing you to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch.  

   :::caution
   Make sure to change the base repository to your fork instead of creating a PR on the original Terrateam repository. The base should be your `main` branch, and the compare should be your `test-branch`.

   Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch.

   :::warning
   Important: Make sure to change the base repository to your fork instead of creating a PR on the original Terrateam repository. The base should be your `main` branch, and the compare should be your `test-branch`.

   :::caution
   Ensure that [workflows are enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow#enabling-a-workflow) on your forked repository. If GitHub Actions workflows are disabled, you'll need to enable them in the repository settings.
   :::

8. **Watch the Automatic Terraform Plan**

   Once the pull request is created, Terrateam will automatically trigger a [`terraform plan`](/getting-started/plan-and-apply). This plan will appear as a comment on your pull request, showing what changes would be made.  

   
   ![Automatic Terraform plan in PR comments](../../../assets/demo-plan-output.png)
   
   This plan is a preview of what will happen when you apply the changes.

9. **Apply the Changes**

   To execute the changes, comment `terrateam apply` on the pull request.
   ![Apply the changes](../../../assets/demo-pr-apply.png)
   
   After you add the comment, the Terrateam app will run the `terraform apply` command. This will apply the previous plan to the Terraform file, updating your infrastructure.

10. **Merge Your Changes**

    Once applied and everything looks good, you can merge the pull request to incorporate the changes into your main branch.
