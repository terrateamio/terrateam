Terrateam offers multiple ways to manage sensitive information and customize your Terraform configurations using GitHub secrets, GitLab CI/CD variables, or `.tfvars` files. All methods produce the same outcome, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow and needs for managing Terraform variables.

## Secrets and Variables

### Environment Variables

GitHub [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) and [Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables), or GitLab [CI/CD Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/), can be used to set environment variables. They are translated into environment variables in the Terrateam runtime environment. These environment variables may be referenced in your Terraform code.

## Defining Secrets

You can use the CLI or web interface to define secrets in GitHub or GitLab.

### GitHub

#### Using GitHub CLI

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a secret named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`:

    ```bash
    gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --body "<YOUR_ACTUAL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
    ```

#### Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Access the repository with the Terrateam app installed.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.

3. Click on **New repository secret**.
    ![Step 3: New repository secret](../../../assets/new-repo-secret.png)
4. Specify the **Name** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) and a **Secret value** (replace with your actual AWS access key ID).
5. Click **Add secret**.

### GitLab

#### Using GitLab Web Interface

1. Access your GitLab project.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Variables**.
3. Click **Add variable**.
4. Specify the **Key** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) and **Value** (replace with your actual AWS access key ID).
5. Select **Mask variable** to hide it in logs.
6. Click **Add variable**.

## Using Secrets in Terraform

Secrets and variables that start with `TF_VAR_` are treated specially by Terrateam.

Secrets and variables are typically uppercase, however by convention Terraform variables are lowercase. Terrateam automatically finds all secrets that start with `TF_VAR_` and creates a new environment variable that has the lowercase name. If the lowercase name exists, no action is taken. The uppercase environment variable is left unchanged. For example, the secret `TF_VAR_LOGIN_TOKEN` will create a new environment variable called `TF_VAR_login_token`.

This will create an environment variable `TF_VAR_database_password` which Terraform can automatically map to a variable named `database_password` in your Terraform configuration.

```hcl
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Password for database connection"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  # Other configuration...
  password = var.database_password
}
```
### Security

Secrets are stored encrypted at rest and are only decrypted when used in workflows. 

When Terrateam runs your Terraform operations:

1. Encrypted secrets are decrypted within the runtime environment.
2. Decrypted secrets are made available as environment variables within the runner.

<Aside type="tip" title="Your data is protected">
Terrateam does not store unencrypted secrets on its servers. Secrets are decrypted only within the runtime environment and are treated as sensitive environment variables.

To prevent accidental exposure, secrets are automatically masked in logs and comments, including when Terraform output is posted back to pull requests or merge requests.
</Aside>

The Terraform plan files, which may contain sensitive data such as decrypted secrets, are stored temporarily during the plan and apply phases, then immediately deleted.

## Hooks and Workflows

Terrateam also allows you to set environment variables using [Hooks](/configuration-reference/hooks) and [Workflows](/configuration-reference/workflows).

### Hooks

You can set an environment variable at the very start of a Terrateam operation using Hooks.

```yaml
hooks:
  plan:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ['echo', 'BAR']
  apply:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: BAZ
        cmd: ['echo', 'QUX']
```

The following code snippet shows how to set a dynamic environment variable based on the current Git branch:

```yaml
hooks:
  plan:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH
        cmd: ['bash', '-c', 'echo $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)']
```

### Workflows

You can also set an environment variable at the start of each Plan and Apply operation.

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ["echo", "BAR"]
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ["echo", "BAR"]
      - type: apply
```

## `.tfvars` Files

Terraform allows you to define variables in `.tfvars` files, which can be used to customize your Terraform configurations.

To use a `.tfvars` file with Terrateam, you can specify the file path in your workflow configuration using the `extra_args` option.

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
        extra_args: ["-var-file=qa.tfvars"]
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```

The following code snippet shows an example of a `.tfvars` file:

```hcl
# qa.tfvars
region        = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t3.micro"
vpc_cidr      = "10.0.0.0/16"
environment   = "qa"
```

In this example, the `qa.tfvars` file will be used during the plan step, providing environment-specific variable values to your Terraform configuration.
