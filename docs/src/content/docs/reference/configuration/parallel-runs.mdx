title: parallel_runs  
description: The parallel_runs configuration reference
---

The `parallel_runs` configuration in Terrateam specifies how many concurrent Terraform runs can be executed across different directories or environments. Parallel runs can improve the efficiency of infrastructure changes, particularly for large-scale projects.

## Default Configuration

```yaml
parallel_runs: 3
```

## Keys

| Key            | Type    | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `parallel_runs`| Integer | Specifies how many Terraform runs can be executed concurrently. The default is 3, but this value can be adjusted based on your project's needs and available resources. |

## Example Configuration

```yaml
parallel_runs: 5
```
This configuration increases the maximum number of parallel Terraform runs to 5, allowing you to adjust based on your infrastructure's capacity and the complexity of your operations.

## Considerations
- Increasing the number of parallel runs can improve speed but may require higher resource usage.
- Ensure your infrastructure can handle the number of parallel runs without bottlenecks or throttling.
- Parallel runs are ideal for environments or directories that can be processed simultaneously, maximizing efficiency.
