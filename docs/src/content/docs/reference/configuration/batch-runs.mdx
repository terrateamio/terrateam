title: batch_runs
description: Configure how large each run should be.
---

In a large repository, it may not be possible to run all workspaces in a single GitHub Action run due to CPU and disk space limitations.  The `batch_runs` configuration allows specifying the maximum number of workspaces in individual action runs.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
batch_runs:
  enabled: false
  max_workspaces_per_batch: 1
```

## Keys
| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| enabled | Boolean | Specifies whether the batch runs is enabled. Default is false. |
| max_workspaces_per_batch | Number | Maximum number of workspaces that each run can contain. Default is 1. |

## Functionality
If batch runs is enabled, the following happens:

1. Tree builder, config builder, and indexer all will be executed in their own action run.
2. If the number of workspaces that can be run in a single action run is greater than `max_workspaces_per_batch`, additional action runs will be created with the additional workspaces.

## Considerations

Terrateam does not limit how many action runs it will run at concurrently.  For example, if a change has 100 workspaces, and `max_workspaces_per_batch` is set to `1`, Terrateam will create 100 GitHub Action runs at the same time.
