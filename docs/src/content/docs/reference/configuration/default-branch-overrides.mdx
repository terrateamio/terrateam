description: Configure which configurations come from the default branch
---

The `default_branch_overrides` configuration allows you to specify which root keys in the configuration are sourced from the default branch.  By default, the keys `access_control`, `apply_requirements`, and `destination_branches` are all sourced from the default branch.  Only root-level keys may be specified.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
default_branch_overrides:
  - access_control
  - apply_requirements
  - destination_branches
```

## Examples
### Allow apply requirements to be specified in a feature branch.
```yaml
default_branch_overrides:
  - access_control
  - destination_branches
```
## Considerations
When setting `default_branch_overrides`:

1. Remember to specify all configuration keys that **must** come from the default branch.
2. By removing a key from the overrides, it may be defined in any feature branch, so take caution with any keys related to the security of the system.
