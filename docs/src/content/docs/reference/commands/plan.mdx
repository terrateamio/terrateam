The `terrateam plan` command executes the plan workflow against changes in a pull request.

## All Changes

## Target a Directory
To plan a specific directory, use the `dir` implicit tag:
```
terrateam plan dir:directory-name
```
Replace `directory-name` with the name of the directory you want to target.

## Target a Workspace
To plan a specific workspace, use the `workspace` implicit tag:
```
terrateam plan workspace:workspace-name
```
Replace `workspace-name` with the name of the workspace you want to target.

## Target a Tag Query
To plan a specific tag query, use the following command:
```
terrateam plan <tag-query>
```
Replace `<tag-query>` with your desired tag query. [Learn more about our tag queries](/advanced-workflows/tags).
