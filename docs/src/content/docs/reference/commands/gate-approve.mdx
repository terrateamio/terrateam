title: terrateam gate approve
description: Approve a gated workflow step that failed validation
---

When a workflow step with [gate configuration](/reference/configuration/workflows#gate-configuration) fails (such as security scanning, policy checks, or custom validation), Terrateam creates an approval request that authorized users can approve to continue the workflow.

## Usage

```
terrateam gate approve <token>
```

## Parameters

- `<token>` - The unique token identifier for the gate request (provided in the gate failure message)

## Related Commands

- [terrateam apply-force](/reference/commands/apply-force) - Force an apply without meeting apply requirements
- [terrateam apply-autoapprove](/reference/commands/apply-autoapprove) - Skip approvals entirely

## Security Considerations

:::caution
Gate approvals bypass failed validation checks. Ensure only trusted users have approval permissions and maintain an audit trail of all approvals.
:::

- Limit gate approval permissions to appropriate teams
- Use descriptive tokens to identify what's being approved
- Consider requiring multiple approvers for critical workflows
