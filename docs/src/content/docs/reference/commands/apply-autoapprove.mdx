## Examples

### Auto-Apply All Changes
```
terrateam apply-autoapprove
```

### Target Specific Resources

```bash
# Auto-apply to development environment
terrateam apply-autoapprove dev

# Auto-apply a specific directory
terrateam apply-autoapprove dir:staging

# Auto-apply with complex query
terrateam apply-autoapprove non-prod and dir:config
```

## Workflow Behavior

This command combines two operations:

1. **Plan Phase**
   - Runs terraform init
   - Executes terraform plan
   - Generates plan output

2. **Apply Phase** (automatic)
   - Immediately applies the plan
   - No manual review step
   - No approval required

## Access Control

:::warning
Restrict autoapprove to appropriate environments and users.
:::

Configure permissions in [access control](/reference/configuration/access-control).

## Tag Query Support

Supports [tag queries](/reference/configuration/tag-queries) to filter operations:

- `dir:<path>` - Target specific directory
- `workspace:<name>` - Target specific workspace
- Tags can be referenced directly (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `dev`)
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
