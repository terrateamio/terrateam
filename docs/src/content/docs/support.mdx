### Basic Plan

### Enterprise Plan
| Severity        | First Response Time | Working Hours                           |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Critical        | 4 hour              | 24x7                                    |

## Definitions of Severity Levels

- **Severity 1 - Critical**: A critical incident with very high impact, such as a complete outage of a customer-facing service.
- **Severity 2 - Major**: A major incident with significant impact, such as a partial outage affecting a subset of customers.
- **Severity 3 - Minor**: A minor incident with low impact, such as a minor loss of functionality or performance issues.
- **Severity 4 - General Guidance**: Requests for information, enhancements, or documentation clarification that do not impact the operation of Terrateam.

Severity is determined by Terrateam support engineers based on the information provided. Clearly communicate the extent and impact of the issue when contacting support to ensure proper severity assignment.

## What's Supported?

The scope of support defines what Terrateam supports and what is outside the support boundaries. This ensures consistent and efficient support experiences. Support outside this scope is at the discretion of the support engineer and provided as a courtesy.
