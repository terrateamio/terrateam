Terrateam Self-Hosted allows you to run Terrateam on your own infrastructure, giving you complete control over your Terraform automation while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

:::note[Open Source vs Enterprise]
The self-hosted Docker and Kubernetes deployments use the Open Source edition by default. For enterprise features like RBAC, Centralized Configuration, and Gatekeeper, see our [Editions and Licensing](/self-hosted/editions/) guide.

## Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure and requirements:
