title: Ignoring a Directory
description: Learn how to configure Terrateam to ignore specific directories and prevent automatic plans and applies in them.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In some cases, you may want to prevent Terrateam from running plans or applies within certain directories or files in your repository.

**Why ignore directories or files?**  
This is especially useful for:
- Directories with Terraform modules that are not meant to be deployed directly (for example, shared modules or templates).
- Supporting files or folders that match Terraform file patterns (like `.tf`), but should not trigger infrastructure changes.

:::tip
The `file_patterns` configuration supports glob patterns (see [Dirs reference](/configuration-reference/dirs#globs)). You can use this to precisely match or exclude files and directories.
:::

## How to Ignore a Directory

To ignore a directory in Terrateam, add it to the `dirs` section in your `.terrateam/config.yml` file and set `when_modified.file_patterns` to an empty list.

**Example: Ignore the `docs` directory**
```yaml
dirs:
  docs:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```
Changes to files in the `docs` directory will not trigger any plans or applies.

## Ignoring Module Directories

If you have a directory containing Terraform modules (for example, `modules/`), and you do not want changes in these modules to trigger runs directly, you can ignore the entire directory:

```yaml
dirs:
  modules:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

## Ignoring Specific Files

You can also ignore specific files by using their path as a key in the `dirs` section and setting `file_patterns` to an empty list:

**Example: Ignore a specific file**
```yaml
dirs:
  foobar.tf:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

:::tip
You can use glob patterns to ignore groups of files, such as all dev.*.tfvars files:
:::

```yaml
dirs:
  "dev.*.tfvars":
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

## Advanced: Ignoring by Pattern

You can use glob patterns to ignore files or directories matching a pattern. For example, to ignore all files in a `test/` directory:

```yaml
dirs:
  test/**:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

Or to ignore all files ending in `.example.tf`:

```yaml
dirs:
  "**/*.example.tf":
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

:::tip
The `${DIR}` variable can be used in `file_patterns` to refer to the current directory. See [Dirs reference](/configuration-reference/dirs#when-modified) for more details.
:::

## Best Practices

- Use precise patterns to avoid unintentionally ignoring important infrastructure code.
- Review the [Dirs configuration reference](/configuration-reference/dirs) for more on glob patterns and advanced matching.
- Remember that ignoring a directory or file means no plans or applies will be triggered for changes within it.

If you need to ignore more complex patterns or have questions about matching behavior, see the [Globs section](/configuration-reference/dirs#globs) in the configuration reference.
