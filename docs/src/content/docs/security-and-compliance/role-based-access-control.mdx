title: Role-Based Access Control
description: Control access to Terrateam operations with role-based access control
---

Terrateam provides a comprehensive permission system that allows you to control who can perform Terrateam operations against your infrastructure. By configuring role-based access control, you can ensure that only authorized users can make changes to your infrastructure, reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized modifications.

## Access Control
Terrateam's [access control](/configuration-reference/access-control) feature is the foundation of the permission system. It allows you to define a set of capabilities, such as plan and apply, and specify which users or groups can perform those operations.

### Enabling Access Control
To enable access control, add the following to your Terrateam configuration file (`.terrateam/config.yml`):
```yaml
access_control:
  enabled: true
```

### Configuring Access Control Policies
Access control policies define the capabilities and permissions for different users, groups, and roles. Here's an example configuration:

:::caution
The order of `policies` is important and should always be listed with a `tag_query` from most specific to most general.  This is because, when Terrateam evaluates a policy, it uses the first policy in the list that matches.

`tag_query: ''` is the most general and matches everything and should always be last.
:::

```yaml
access_control:
  enabled: true
  apply_require_all_dirspace_access: true
  plan_require_all_dirspace_access: false
  terrateam_config_update: ['*']
  unlock: ['*']
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''
      apply: ['role:maintain']
      apply_autoapprove: ['user:alice']
      apply_force: ['team:sre']
      apply_with_superapproval: ['role:write']
      plan: ['*']
      superapproval: ['user:bob']
```
In this example:
- The `apply` capability is granted to users with the `maintain` role in the repository.
- The `apply_autoapprove` capability is granted to the user `alice`.
- The `apply_force` capability is granted to members of the `sre` team.
- The `apply_with_superapproval` capability is granted to users with the `write` role in the repository, but only if a user with the `superapproval` capability has approved the pull request.
- The `plan` capability is granted to all users (`*`).
- The `superapproval` capability is granted to the user `bob`.

## Plan Permissions
The `plan` capability in access control determines who can perform plan operations on your infrastructure. By default, Terrateam grants the `plan` capability to all users (`*`), allowing anyone to generate and review plans for proposed changes.

However, you can restrict plan permissions to specific users or groups by modifying the `plan` policy in your `access_control` configuration.

For example, to grant plan permissions only to users with the `write` role, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
access_control:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''
      plan: ['role:write']
```

## Apply Permissions
The `apply` capability in access control determines who can perform apply operations on your infrastructure. By default, Terrateam grants the `apply` capability to all users (`*`), allowing anyone to apply
changes.

You can customize apply permissions by modifying the `apply` policy in your `access_control` configuration.

For example, to grant apply permissions to a specific team, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
access_control:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''
      apply: ['team:devops']
```

### Apply Requirements
In addition to the `apply` capability, Terrateam has a set of [apply requirements](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements) that must be met before an apply operation can be executed. These requirements help ensure that changes to your infrastructure are properly reviewed and approved before being applied.

By default, Terrateam has the following apply requirements:
- The pull request must not have any merge conflicts.
- All status checks associated with the pull request must have passed.

You can configure these requirements in your Terrateam configuration file using the `apply_requirements.checks` section.

For example:
```yaml
apply_requirements:
  checks:
    approved:
      enabled: true
      count: 2
    merge_conflicts:
      enabled: true
    status_checks:
      enabled: true
      ignore_matching:
        - "ci/.*"
```

In this example, the apply requirements are configured as follows:
- The pull request must have at least 2 approvals.
- The pull request must not have any merge conflicts.
- All status checks associated with the pull request must have passed, except for those matching the regular expression `ci/.*`.

### Apply Overrides
In some situations, you may need to override the apply requirements and force an apply operation. Terrateam provides two ways to override the apply requirements:

##### `terrateam apply-force`
Users with the `apply_force` capability can use this command to bypass all apply requirements and force an apply operation.

##### `terrateam apply-autoapprove`
Users with the `apply_autoapprove` capability can use this command to automatically approve and apply changes without requiring additional approvals.

:::danger[Warning]
Override capabilities should be granted only to trusted users who understand the potential risks and consequences of bypassing apply requirements.
:::

## Combining Plan and App Permissions
By combining plan and apply permissions, you can create a granular and secure permission system that reflects your organization's roles and responsibilities. For example, you can grant plan permissions to a wider group of users, allowing them to propose and review changes, while restricting apply permissions to a smaller group of trusted users who can approve and execute those changes.

Here's an example configuration that demonstrates this approach:
```yaml
access_control:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''
      plan: ['role:write']
      apply: ['role:maintain']
      apply_autoapprove: ['user:alice']
      apply_force: ['team:sre']
```

In this configuration:
- Users with the `write` role can perform plan operations and propose changes.
- Users with the `maintain` role can perform apply operations and approve changes.
- The user `alice` can use the `apply-autoapprove` command to automatically approve and apply changes.
- Members of the `sre` team can use the `apply-force` command to bypass apply requirements and force an apply operation.

## Best Practices
When configuring plan and apply permissions, consider the following best practices:
- Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.
- Use the `apply_require_all_dirspace_access` and `plan_require_all_dirspace_access` settings to control whether users need access to all targeted directories ([dirspaces](/getting-started/concepts#dirspace)) to perform apply or plan operations.
