      (* --- Security regression tests ---------------------------------------
         MQL identifiers (table/column/alias names) are rendered verbatim and
         text-substituted into the generated SQL. Two vulnerabilities followed
         from that; each case below returned [Ok] (or raised) before its fix
         and returns the expected [Error] after:

         - Unvalidated column references: a query could name a column that is
           not in the schema and have it passed straight through into the
           generated SQL, letting a caller probe the real database schema.
           Columns are now validated against the MQL schema in select lists,
           GROUP BY and ORDER BY, and the check is not suppressed by an
           unrelated WITH.

         - SQL injection via identifiers: an identifier containing a quote or
           semicolon was substituted into the SQL verbatim; [of_mql] now
           rejects any identifier outside the [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*] charset.

         An aliased unknown table additionally raised an uncaught [Not_found],
         surfacing as a 500 instead of a clean error. *)
