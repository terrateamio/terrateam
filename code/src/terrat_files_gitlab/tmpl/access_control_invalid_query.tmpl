## Access Control :no_entry:

Permissions to perform this operation could not be performed because the following policy entry is invalid:

`@query@`

The access control rules are sourced from the Terrateam [configuration file](https://terrateam.io/docs/configuration) in the `@default_branch@` branch.

See the [documentation](https://docs.terrateam.io/configuration-reference/access-control/) to learn how to configure access control.
