# Potentially Stale Operations Detected
Terrateam has identified potentially stale operations whose current status cannot be determined. This occurs when GitHub fails to provide status updates. **These are blocking the execution of this operation**.

## What to Do Next
- **If the operations are still in progress**, no immediate action is necessary. This operation will run automatically when they complete.
- **If the operations have encountered failures**, follow the instructions below to unlock them, this operation will resume automatically.

   <summary><h3>Potentially Stale Operations</h3></summary>

| Pull Request | Operation | State | Created At |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
@#work_manifests-@
| @?is_pr-@ #@id@ @-/is_pr@@!is_pr-@ @id@ @-/is_pr@ | @run_type@ | @state@ | @created_at@ UTC |
@/work_manifests-@

If these appear to be stuck, unlock them by commenting in any pull request:

```
terrateam unlock@-#work_manifests@ @id@@/work_manifests@
```

**Be careful when unlocking.**  Make sure that these runs are actually stuck by verifying if there are any running GitHub Actions workflows.

If this persists, verify the GitHub Action workflow matches the [documentation](https://terrateam.io/docs/getting-started).
