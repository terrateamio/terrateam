## Cycle in dependency graph

### What is this?

There is a cycle between dirspaces that is preventing operations from being evaluated.  This means that a two or more dirspaces depend on each other.

Here is an example of the cycle:

@#cycle-@
- `@dir@:@workspace@`
@/cycle-@

### What to do?

The cycle must be removed. To do this, modify the `depends_on` sections of the in the configuration file.
