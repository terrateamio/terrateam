## Access Control :no_entry:

The operation could not be performed because the user `@user@` does not have permissions on the following [dirspaces](https://docs.terrateam.io/getting-started/concepts/#dirspace).

| Dir | Workspace | Policy
| --- | --------- | ------ |
@#denies-@
| `@dir@` | `@workspace@` | @^match_list@@#match_list@`@item@` @/match_list-@@/match_list@@^!match_list@**No matching policy**@/match_list@ |
@/denies-@

The access control rules are sourced from the Terrateam [configuration file](https://terrateam.io/docs/configuration) in the `@default_branch@` branch.

See the [documentation](https://docs.terrateam.io/configuration-reference/access-control/) to learn how to configure access control.
