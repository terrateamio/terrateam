  (* Which gated constructs a parsed query actually uses.

     A complete walk.  Every gated construct is a statement shape, or a [locking]
     clause on a query, and both can hide inside a subquery in expression
     position -- [exists (with a as (delete ...) select 1)] holds a
     data-modifying statement that no top-level form names.  The walk therefore
     reaches every statement and every expression of the tree, and the compiler
     enforces the exhaustive matches, so a new constructor cannot be added
     without deciding whether it is gated.  One hole stays, deliberately: a
     function body is held verbatim (see [Func_as_body]) and the walk cannot
     read inside one; [Create_function] is itself gated, which covers what its
