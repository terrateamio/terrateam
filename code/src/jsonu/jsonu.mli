(** [merge] takes a a starting json, [base], and merges another json, [override] on top of it. The
    following rules are applied for merging:

    - If a key is in [base] and [override] and has a scalar type, the value from [override] is
      taken.

    - If a key is in [base] and [override] and it is a list then the items from [override] are
      prepended to the items in [base].

    - If a key is in [base] and [override] and it is a dictionary, [merge] is recursively applied.

    - If a key is in [base] and [override] and either has a value of [null], then the value from
      [override] is taken.

    - If a key is in [base] and [override] and no other rule applies, then a
      [`Type_mismatch_err key] is returned.

    - All keys from [override] are added to the result.

    Note that no deep merging of lists is performed. *)
