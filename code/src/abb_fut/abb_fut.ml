     The interesting case is when [u] is undetermined and [v] is a [`Det _]

     The outer join is going to create a future that will evaluate whatever [f3]
     finally evaluates to.  Along the way, that future will keep on being
     updated as an alias to the various futures created along the way to
     evaluate f3. *)
