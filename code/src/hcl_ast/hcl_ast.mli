(** HCL parsing to an AST that mirrors hclsyntax's.

    {1 What this AST represents, and what it does not}

    This is an abstract syntax tree in the same sense hclsyntax's is, and deliberately no richer: it
    carries what a config MEANS, not how it was written. Surface syntax that hclsyntax discards is
    absent here too — the [-] of a [<<-] heredoc and its body's original indentation (the
    common-indent strip is applied while parsing, as hclsyntax applies it), redundant parentheses,
    the column of a heredoc's closing marker, comments, and line structure. A number is a [float] or
    an [int], not the lexeme that produced it.

    That alignment is an invariant, not an accident. The fixture goldens in [tests/hcl_ast] hold
    this parser and the Go shim (hclsyntax) to the same AST for every fixture, with
    [ast_divergent_positive_fixtures] empty. Representing something hclsyntax throws away therefore
    costs that parity for every affected fixture, which is why enriching the AST is not the way to
    preserve surface syntax.

    Terraform keeps surface syntax in a different representation: hclwrite's CST, which is what
    [tofu fmt] rewrites. Byte-level fidelity to a source file — preserving comments, layout, or
    [<<-] — is a token-preserving printer, a separate concern from this AST. What {!To_string} does
    guarantee is that its output loads and means the same thing; see [Hcl_ast_to_string]. *)
