(* Tests for the pool-saturation fallback path and for the
   pinned-stays-on-loop / unpinned-can-leave-loop guarantees.

   When [Abb_domain_pool.try_enqueue] sees no idle worker the scheduler
   runs unpinned task work on the loop domain instead of queueing it
   behind whatever is occupying the pool.  These tests construct
   saturation deliberately by parking [Thread.run] payloads on a held
   [Mutex], then assert (a) where the work actually ran (using
   [Domain.self ()]) and (b) that it completed.

   A separate test, on multi-core machines, asserts that unpinned task
   bodies do reach worker domains when the pool has idle slots — the
   parallelism payoff that motivated the unpinned model in the first
   place.  And a final test asserts that pinned tasks {b never} leave
   the loop, even when workers are available. *)
