(* Multi-domain channel / op cross-domain routing invariants.

   These exercise the rule that a parked operation's resume (and an async op's callback) is routed to
   the task that *drives* the operation -- read from the run state at act time -- not from where the
   operation was *constructed*.  A routing bug puts two domains on one [Abb_fut.State.t]; under the
   debug build ([ABB_FUT_DEBUG=1], the dev profile) the cross-domain owner-CAS aborts the whole
   process with exit 134, failing the suite.  (Same in-process mechanism as [abb_test_unpinned_send].)

   Multi-domain bugs come from the *interaction* of several pieces, so each scenario is a choreographed
   sequence: drive one piece to a known point (park, then hold its worker domain with a CPU spin),
   *then* have a counterparty act, using atomics as barriers to make the interleaving deterministic.

   Schedulers without [`Multi_domain] cannot exhibit the hazard, so the suite fast-succeeds there. *)

  (* Hold the current worker domain (and thus this task's run state) busy: announce via [spinning],
     then spin until [release] is set.  Used inside an unpinned task to keep its [worker_state] owned
     while a counterparty on another domain fires a resume into it. *)

    Atomic.set spinning true;
    while not (Atomic.get release) do
      Domain.cpu_relax ()

  (* Generic overlap driver.  [op] is a future *constructed by the caller* (typically on the loop
     domain -- the out-of-context case).  An unpinned task forks [op] (so it is *driven* on the task's
     worker_state and parks there), then holds the worker with a spin.  The loop waits until the
     worker is spinning, runs [fire] (the counterparty that resumes [op]), gives the loop time to
     process the resume *while the worker still owns its state*, then releases the worker and awaits
     the task.  On buggy routing the resume runs inline on the loop -> two domains on the worker_state
     -> exit 134.

     Unpinned tasks are only *best-effort* parallel: under pool saturation the scheduler may run the
     body inline on the loop domain, where [hold_worker]'s spin would wedge the loop.  So the body
     first checks whether it landed on the loop domain and, if so, bails *before forking [op]* (a
     side-effect-free no-op, since Abb futures are lazy); the driver then retries until the body lands
     on a real worker domain.  With an idle pool the first attempt succeeds.  This keeps the test
     robust to scheduling decisions it does not control (e.g. transient saturation when the whole
     test tree runs in parallel). *)
