### What to do?

To continue, users matching the `Required Approvers` and `Any Approvers` must approve the gate until all approvals are satisfied.

To approve a gate with a token, comment the following:

```
terrateam gate approve <token>
```

Where `<token>` is the token to be approved.

To approve a gate without a token, approve the pull request.

#### How Gatekeeper requirements work

Gatekeeper uses `all_of`, `any_of`, and `any_of_count` to define approval rules:

- `all_of` - Lists users or groups that must approve unconditionally.
- `any_of` - Lists users or groups that may approve.
- `any_of_count` - Sets how many approvals are required from the `any_of` list.

A gate is satisfied only when all conditions are met. See [documentation](https://docs.terrateam.io/advanced-workflows/gatekeeper-requirements) for details.
