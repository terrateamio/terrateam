    server, and it returns one row. Thus a call cannot read data outside the schema, and it does not
    change the number of rows that [LIMIT] and pagination count.

    The list:

    The safety guarantee: for any AST, this either fails or returns a query that reads nothing
    outside [schema] — every table is in the schema or is a CTE the query itself binds, every
    function is in [func_allow_list], every cast is in [cast_allow_list], every identifier is
    in-charset, and no [$name] variable survives. That guarantee is what lets the caller substitute
    the rendered query into a template whose tenant-scoped CTEs shadow the real tables (see
    [code/src/sgs_mql/sql/select_mql_page.sql]); a name that escaped the schema would resolve to the
    real, unscoped table.

    The guarantee is enforced twice — by the rewrite itself, and by an independent audit of the

    {!of_mql} runs this over its own output, so a caller does not need to. No production caller
    names it: the audits that matter run inside {!of_mql}. It is a test hook -- the guarantee is
    worth being able to assert directly, over any AST, including one no parser would produce -- and
    it lives in {!Tests} for that reason.

    Deliberately shares no code with the rewrite's own guards. That is the whole point: it is a
