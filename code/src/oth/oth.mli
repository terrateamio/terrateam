(** {1 Assertions}

    Assertions are pure and synchronous: they either return a value or raise, and the raise is
    caught by whichever backend's [catch] is running the test. They are therefore backend-
    independent and live OUTSIDE {!S}, so {!Make} does not expose them.

    The vocabulary is named as a signature rather than only bound as a module so that a backend can
    EXTEND it instead of redeclaring it: {!Oth_abb.ASSERT} is [ASSERT] plus the assertions that name
    an [Abb_intf] type, which keeps this library free of a dependency on [abb_intf]. An async test
    can therefore reach every assertion through one module path, [Oth_abb.Assert.*], while a
    synchronous one uses [Oth.Assert.*]; the two share this implementation. *)

  (** Invert a test's outcome: it passes when the wrapped test FAILS, and fails when it passes.

      For a KNOWN GAP — behaviour that is specified but does not work yet. Write the test asserting
      what the code SHOULD do, wrap it here, and the suite stays green while the gap is open. The
      specification then lives in the assertions rather than in a comment, and the day the behaviour
      starts working this fails and tells you to remove the wrapper. The alternatives are worse: a
      test that asserts the DEFECT encodes the wrong thing and has to be rewritten to close the gap,
      and a permanently-red test becomes noise nobody reads.

      [~reason] is quoted in that failure message; say what the gap was.

      [OTH_DISABLE_EXPECT_FAILURE=1] disables the inversion, so a run reports what each test
      ACTUALLY did. Use it to see the true state: which gaps are still open, and — the case
      inversion hides — a gap that has started passing for the WRONG reason, because its fixture
      broke or its assertions stopped reaching the interesting code. A suite of wrapped tests is
      uniformly green either way, so that variable is the only way to tell those apart.

      [`Timedout] and [`Skipped] are NOT inverted. A timeout is not evidence the expected assertion
      failed, only that the test never reached it; a skip means tag filtering excluded the body, and
      inverting it would manufacture a pass. *)

      tests or [teardown] are surfaced by the backend's [run_suite] (exit 1 for the Abb backend).

      run-level or phase setup prints the message and exits 1 (the run-level [teardown] still runs
